      <h2>About</h2>
      <img class="image" id="profile" src="images/pic03.png" alt="">
      <span>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Matías, a mid-30s self-learner with a strong interest in
          technology, programming, and all things related to software
          development. I consider myself a naturally curious and
          detail-oriented individual, always seeking to expand my horizons.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey as a developer began by disassembling broken computers to
          understand their inner workings, igniting my curiosity and passion
          for technology. I furthered my knowledge by taking certified courses
          in computer repair, which provided me with a solid foundation in
          hardware and troubleshooting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Continuing my learning path, I delved into the world of programming
          by enrolling in certified Java courses tailored for non-programmers.
          These courses covered Java SE8, object-oriented programming (OOP),
          and basic SQL, helping me grasp the syntax and fundamental concepts
          of Java and database interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          To stay up-to-date, I recently completed an introductory Java
          course, reinforcing my knowledge and staying current with the
          language's latest developments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I'm fully immersed in a dynamic full-stack bootcamp,
          where I'm gaining proficiency in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and
          vanilla JavaScript. This comprehensive bootcamp is equipping me with
          essential skills for building robust web applications, from
          efficient back-end functionalities in Python and Django to crafting
          captivating user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my journey, I've embraced continuous learning and
          hands-on projects to hone my skills. I believe that practical
          application is the best way to learn, and I enjoy experimenting with
          different tools and technologies to find innovative solutions to
          complex problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I take pride in my organizational skills and attention to detail,
          approaching every task with a meticulous mindset to ensure nothing
          is overlooked. From planning and executing projects to managing my
          time effectively, I strive for excellence in all my endeavors.
        </p>

        <p>
          With a curious nature, a passion for technology, and an unwavering
          attention to detail, I'm dedicated to continuous growth and
          self-improvement. I eagerly embrace new challenges and seize
          opportunities to further expand my knowledge and skills in the
          ever-evolving field of software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am excited about the limitless possibilities that lie ahead, and I
          look forward to making meaningful contributions in any endeavor I
          undertake.
        </p>
