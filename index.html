          <p>
            Hello, I'm Matías, a mid-30s self-learner with a strong interest in
            technology, programming, and all things related to software
            development. I consider myself a naturally curious and
            detail-oriented individual, always seeking to expand my horizons.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey as a developer began by disassembling broken computers to
            understand their inner workings, igniting my curiosity and passion
            for technology. I furthered my knowledge by taking certified courses
            in computer repair, which provided me with a solid foundation in
            hardware and troubleshooting.
          </p>

          <p>
            Continuing my learning path, I delved into the world of programming
            by enrolling in certified Java courses tailored for non-programmers.
            These courses covered Java SE8, object-oriented programming (OOP),
            and basic SQL, helping me grasp the syntax and fundamental concepts
            of Java and database interactions.
          </p>

          <p>
            To stay up-to-date, I recently completed an introductory Java
            course, reinforcing my knowledge and staying current with the
            language's latest developments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I'm fully immersed in a dynamic full-stack bootcamp,
            where I'm gaining proficiency in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and
            vanilla JavaScript. This comprehensive bootcamp is equipping me with
            essential skills for building robust web applications, from
            efficient back-end functionalities in Python and Django to crafting
            captivating user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout my journey, I've embraced continuous learning and
            hands-on projects to hone my skills. I believe that practical
            application is the best way to learn, and I enjoy experimenting with
            different tools and technologies to find innovative solutions to
            complex problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            I take pride in my organizational skills and attention to detail,
            approaching every task with a meticulous mindset to ensure nothing
            is overlooked. From planning and executing projects to managing my
            time effectively, I strive for excellence in all my endeavors.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a curious nature, a passion for technology, and an unwavering
            attention to detail, I'm dedicated to continuous growth and
            self-improvement. I eagerly embrace new challenges and seize
            opportunities to further expand my knowledge and skills in the
            ever-evolving field of software development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am excited about the limitless possibilities that lie ahead, and I
            look forward to making meaningful contributions in any endeavor I
            undertake.
