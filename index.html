			<article id="about">
				<h2 class="major">About</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Hello, I'm Mat√≠as, a mid-30s self-learner with a strong interest in technology, programming, and all
					things related to software development. I consider myself a naturally curious and detail-oriented
					individual, always seeking to expand my horizons.</p>

				<p>My journey as a developer began by disassembling broken computers to understand their inner
					workings, igniting my curiosity and passion for technology. I furthered my knowledge by taking
					certified courses in computer repair, which provided me with a solid foundation in hardware and
					troubleshooting.</p>

				<p>Continuing my learning path, I delved into the world of programming by enrolling in certified Java
					courses tailored for non-programmers. These courses covered Java SE8, object-oriented programming
					(OOP), and basic SQL, helping me grasp the syntax and fundamental concepts of Java and database
					interactions.</p>

				<p>To stay up-to-date, I recently completed an introductory Java course, reinforcing my knowledge and
					staying current with the language's latest developments.</p>

				<p>Currently, I'm fully immersed in a dynamic full-stack bootcamp, where I'm gaining proficiency in
					Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This comprehensive bootcamp is equipping me with
					essential skills for building robust web applications, from efficient back-end functionalities in
					Python and Django to crafting captivating user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
				</p>

				<p>Throughout my journey, I've embraced continuous learning and hands-on projects to hone my skills. I
					believe that practical application is the best way to learn, and I enjoy experimenting with
					different tools and technologies to find innovative solutions to complex problems.</p>

				<p>I take pride in my organizational skills and attention to detail, approaching every task with a
					meticulous mindset to ensure nothing is overlooked. From planning and executing projects to managing
					my time effectively, I strive for excellence in all my endeavors.</p>

				<p>With a curious nature, a passion for technology, and an unwavering attention to detail, I'm
					dedicated to continuous growth and self-improvement. I eagerly embrace new challenges and seize
					opportunities to further expand my knowledge and skills in the ever-evolving field of software
					development.</p>

				<p>I am excited about the limitless possibilities that lie ahead, and I look forward to making
					meaningful contributions in any endeavor I undertake.</p>
