                    <p>
                        Since an early age, technology has always been my constant fascination. Through various courses,
                        I've acquired solid knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java.Each of these
                        technologies
                        represents not only a tool but also a gateway to a universe of creative and functional
                        possibilities. From designing interfaces to building interactive applications, I've explored the
                        diverse aspects of web development.

                        I am convinced that web development is a powerful tool for transforming ideas into tangible
                        solutions. My goal is to create experiences that captivate users and effectively solve problems.
                        My
                        current pursuit is focused on securing my first opportunity to apply this knowledge in a
                        professional environment. I am eager to face challenges and contribute to the world of software
                        development with a fresh approach oriented towards continuous growth.

                    <h3>My most recent work experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am responsible for an administrative department at a motor vehicle property
                        registry,
                        where I have been able to develop skills in organization, attention to detail, and effective
                        communication.

                        Additionally, I am also an intermediate-level student in the field of law, which provides me
                        with a
                        solid understanding of the legal and ethical implications surrounding software development. This
                        enables me to contribute to ensuring that products and applications comply with legal and
                        ethical
                        standards, particularly crucial in areas such as data protection and user privacy.

                        I am confident that my background in law, coupled with my administrative skills, brings a
                        valuable
                        perspective that extends beyond the technical aspect of software development.
