        <h2>About</h2>
        <span class="responsive"><img src="images/pic03.png" alt="" /></span>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Mat√≠as, a mid-30s self-learner with a strong interest in
          technology, programming, and all things related to software
          development. I consider myself a naturally curious and detail-oriented
          individual, always seeking to expand my horizons.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey as a developer began by disassembling broken computers to
          understand their inner workings, igniting my curiosity and passion for
          technology. I furthered my knowledge by taking certified courses in
          computer repair, which provided me with a solid foundation in hardware
          and troubleshooting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Continuing my learning path, I delved into the world of programming by
          enrolling in certified Java courses tailored for non-programmers.
          These courses covered Java SE8, object-oriented programming (OOP), and
          basic SQL, helping me grasp the syntax and fundamental concepts of
          Java and database interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          To stay up-to-date, I recently completed an introductory Java course,
          reinforcing my knowledge and staying current with the language's
          latest developments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I'm fully immersed in a dynamic full-stack bootcamp, where
          I'm gaining proficiency in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and vanilla
          JavaScript. This comprehensive bootcamp is equipping me with essential
          skills for building robust web applications, from efficient back-end
          functionalities in Python and Django to crafting captivating user
          interfaces using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my journey, I've embraced continuous learning and hands-on
          projects to hone my skills. I believe that practical application is
          the best way to learn, and I enjoy experimenting with different tools
          and technologies to find innovative solutions to complex problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I take pride in my organizational skills and attention to detail,
          approaching every task with a meticulous mindset to ensure nothing is
          overlooked. From planning and executing projects to managing my time
          effectively, I strive for excellence in all my endeavors.
        </p>

        <p>
          With a curious nature, a passion for technology, and an unwavering
          attention to detail, I'm dedicated to continuous growth and
          self-improvement. I eagerly embrace new challenges and seize
          opportunities to further expand my knowledge and skills in the
          ever-evolving field of software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am excited about the limitless possibilities that lie ahead, and I
          look forward to making meaningful contributions in any endeavor I
          undertake.
