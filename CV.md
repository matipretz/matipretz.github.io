Hey there, I'm Matías, a tech enthusiast in my mid-30s, diving deep into programming and software development. I began by tinkering with broken computers, sparking my passion. Certified courses in computer repair and Java gave me a strong hardware foundation and coding basics. Currently in a dynamic full-stack bootcamp, I'm mastering Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for web apps. I love hands-on learning, solving complex issues with innovative tools, and I'm all about continuous growth. Excited for the endless possibilities in the ever-evolving software world!
