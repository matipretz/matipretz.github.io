Write a short paragraph, aiming to 3-4 lines maximum, explaining who you are, how many years of experience you have and the kind of things you would be able to bring to the company you’re applying to. Use this wisely to highlight your values, principles, achievements and motivations. And really, try to keep it short.

# MOST RECENT WORK EXPERIENCE

<aside>
👇 Add only your most recent and relevant experience(s) by repeating the block below for each one of them.

For instance. you can skip those 3 months at that company that didn't go so well. You can also skip experiences that don't apply to the role you're applying to. Unless you consider you developed there skills you will apply, obviously.

**************************\*\***************************Frequently Asked Questions:**************************\*\***************************
_How many experiences should you include?_
You should only really include detail on roles up to about 10 years old. If you had relevant experience prior than that, you can include a “Previous Experience” section for relevant roles with dates and titles.

_How long should be my CV?_
Keep it short. Remove any unneeded word. The first page should have your 2-3 most recent experiences. Try to keep it short and direct. The whole CV should be 2 pages max! 3 might be ok, but it’s too much.
