# MATÍAS MARTÍN MURAD PRETZ

**I'm transitioning into the software development field with a solid background in administrative roles**

Hey there, I'm Matías, a tech enthusiast in my mid-30s, diving deep into programming and software development. I began by tinkering with broken computers, sparking my passion. Certified courses in computer repair and Java gave me a strong hardware foundation and coding basics. Currently in a dynamic full-stack bootcamp, I'm mastering Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for web apps. I love hands-on learning, solving complex issues with innovative tools, and I'm all about continuous growth. Excited for the endless possibilities in the ever-evolving software world!

## MOST RECENT WORK EXPERIENCE

With a solid experience in administrative roles,I've honed organizational skills, attention to detail, and effective communication. As I venture into software development, I embrace the opportunity to fuse these skills with my passion for technology. I'm actively learning and working on projects, all set to bring a fresh outlook and a strong work ethic to coding. My dedication to growth and problem-solving aligns seamlessly with the expectations of the evolving market and I'm eager to make a meaningful impact in the world of software.
