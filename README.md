# Welcome to Matías Pretz's Personal Page 

## About Me

I'm Matías, a mid-30s self-learner passionate about technology and programming. My curiosity led me to disassemble computers and take repair courses. I then explored Java, OOP, and SQL, and recently refreshed my Java skills. Currently, I'm immersed in a full-stack bootcamp, mastering Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love hands-on learning and have an eye for detail. Always seeking growth, I'm excited to make a meaningful impact as a software developer.
